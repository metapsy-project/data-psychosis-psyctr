The `data-psychosis-psyctr` dataset is a meta-analytic research domain [MARD](https://docs.metapsy.org/uploads/ebmental-2022-300509.pdf) which is part of the  [Metapsy project](https://www.metapsy.org/). The dataset contains study information and effect size data of randomized trials on psychological interventions for schizophrenia and psychosis. The date of the last search update is provided [here](https://github.com/metapsy-project/data-psychosis-psyctr/blob/main/metadata/last_search.txt). More details about a larger version of this dataset can be accessed in the published [network meta-analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920996421000219).

This dataset includes psychological interventions vs. control (`psy vs ctr`) comparisons. Effect sizes are provided for three types of outcomes at post-test: total symptoms, negative symptoms, and positive symptoms. 
It includes one type of effect size calculation per study, giving priority to change scores, followed by means and standard deviations at post-test.

The dataset follows the [Metapsy data standard](https://docs.metapsy.org/data-preparation/format/).
