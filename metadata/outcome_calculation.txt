Similar to Leucht et al. (2013) the total symptom outcome data extracted were within-group mean change score with standard deviation, or if unavailable, post intervention mean score with standard deviation. Unreported standard deviations were calcu- lated from other information or requested from authors, as were missing data for total symptom outcomes. Unreported total PANSS scores were calculated if PANSS positive, negative, and general scales were available, using the correlations reported in Kay et al. (1987).
